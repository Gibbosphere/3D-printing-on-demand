# 3D Printing Spare Parts on Demand - Team 16 (INF3011F 2023)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final documentation for our IT Project Management course project, **3D Printing Spare Parts on Demand**, undertaken by Team 16 for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). This project, which I led, aimed to address challenges faced by asset-heavy industries, particularly mining, in obtaining timely access to spare parts through innovative solutions involving **additive manufacturing (3D printing)**.

## Project Context

Mining operations often face significant downtime due to delayed access to critical spare parts, especially in remote locations. CSIR tasked our team with developing a solution leveraging 3D printing to produce spare parts on demand, reducing lead times, optimizing costs, and improving operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- **Secure access to CAD schematics** for 3D printing while protecting the intellectual property (IP) of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
- Ensure **quality assurance** of 3D-printed spare parts.
- Explore options for **printing premises** (on-site, off-site, hybrid).
- Address **transportation logistics** for spare parts delivery to mines.
- Develop a prototype for a **user-friendly app** to manage part ordering and tracking.

## Solutions Explored

1. **Printing Premises**:
   - On-site, off-site, and hybrid setups were evaluated for feasibility and cost-effectiveness.

2. **Intellectual Property Protection**:
   - Utilized **blockchain technology** and **digital rights management** for secure CAD file transfer.

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Implemented rigorous testing protocols to ensure the structural integrity and reliability of 3D-printed parts.

4. **Transportation**:
   - Proposed a hybrid model combining **trucks** for larger parts and **drones** for smaller, time-sensitive deliveries.

5. **Fine Tuning and Post-Processing**:
   - Developed strategies for support removal and post-printing optimization.

6. **User Application**:
   - Designed a prototype app for ordering and tracking spare parts.

## Project Deliverables

- **Project Documentation**: Detailed report on the proposed solutions and implementation plans.
- **Design Engineering Manual**: A guide for 3D printing mining spare parts.
- **Wireframes**: Prototypes for the ordering and tracking application.
- **Risk Management Plan**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies.

## Challenges and Learnings

The project faced several challenges, including:
- **Time constraints**: Limited project duration.
- **Limited industry expertise**: Gaps in 3D printing and blockchain knowledge.
- **Complex problem statement**: Multiple interconnected components (printing, transportation, quality assurance, etc.).

Despite these, the team delivered comprehensive solutions tailored to CSIRâ€™s needs.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the intersection of **project management**, **additive manufacturing**, and **supply chain optimization**. The proposed solutions aim to enhance the efficiency of mining operations and serve as a foundation for further exploration in 3D printing applications.
